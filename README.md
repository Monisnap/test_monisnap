The two logical exercices are in natif javascript as recommanded so to test them you should copy pass the code and they are not exported as modules. I tried my best to optimize them.

Regarding the webapp, i used a full stack approach and tried to cover all possible aspects of a modern Javascript application, with some unit testing examples, i used typescript on both the front and back side and Docker to build the backend quickly without having to install too many dependencies like database engine. Here is the list of technos I used to develop the app:

 - Docker.
 - MongoDB and Mongoose.
 - Typescript.
 - React.JS.
 - Jest and React Testing Library for testing.
 - MaterialUI and React Router. 
 - DigitalOcean to deploy the app.
