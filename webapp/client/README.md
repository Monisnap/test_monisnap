# Launch Star Wars client localy

  

The project was bootstrapped directly with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I use MaterialUI as UI library, because it's well documented.

  

## How to use

  

For performances reasons I decided not to add the front to the docker-compose so you have to launch it separately from the **docker-compose** stack, for that you need Node installed on your machine to launch the front localy please execute the following command:

  

### npm i && npm start

  

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser to view the demo, backend should be running in 8080 port (please refer to the backend part for more informations).
To generate a build run the following command



### `npm build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
